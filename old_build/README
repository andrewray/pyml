This directory contains files related to the pre-dune build system.

It is required to keep it available until some upstream projects are able to 
convert to dune.  The approach taken here is to keep some deprecated files in 
this 'old_build' directory then reconstruct the prior file system layout using 
some a 'setup' rule in the Makefile.  This is probably not hugely maintainable 
over the long term, but I think suffices for now.
